# os_from_scratch

This is a personal learning project to build a simple, 32-bit operating system kernel from scratch.

##  Source
The entire effort is based on the fantastic book, Writing a Simple Operating System from Scratch by Nick Blundell.

The goal in the end to build upon the foundation that the book gave me and exetend the kernel with my own features for learning purposes
