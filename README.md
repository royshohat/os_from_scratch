# os_from_scratch

This is a personal learning project to build a simple, 32-bit operating system kernel from scratch.

##  Source
The entire effort is based on the fantastic [OS Tutorial](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master/) by cfenollosa.

The goal in the end to build upon the foundation that the course gave me and exetend the kernel with my own features for learning purposes
